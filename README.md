# Object-Detection
This project explores the real-time Python object detection using Matplotlib and OpenCV 
integration. By utilizing pre-trained deep learning models from the OpenCV library, like Single Shot 
Multi-box Detector (SSD) and You Only Look Once (YOLO), the implementation makes it easier to 
accurately and quickly identify objects in a variety of classes in live video streams and webcam feeds.
The methodology includes all necessary processes, such as pre-processing, frame capturing, and 
Matplotlib based real-time object visualization. The outcomes demonstrate how this method can be 
tailored to suit a variety of settings, including robots, human-computer interaction, and surveillance. 
Combining the powerful features of OpenCV and Matplotlib with the ease of use and flexibility of 
Python makes this technique a workable solution for real-time object identification applications.

## Required Software:
Python IDE (Jupyter Notebook), OpenCV, TensorFlow and Matplotlib Library
